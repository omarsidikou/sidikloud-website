    description_martial_arts : >
      I'm an avid Taekwondo and Muay-thaï practioner. Having practiced for more than 25 years the self-control it brings explains 
      in part why I'm such a still and self-confident person. Martial arts is a true passion from where most part of my
      soft skills (resiliance,stress Management,empathy,patience) have been nurtured.

    description_digital_literacy : >
      I'm the founder and director of Super Crack Academy which is an not-for-profit organization,based in France and Niger aims to initiate 
      youth in computer science (robotics,coding).  
      Our approach is to "learn by doing" and "doing more with less". For that reason robotics and Raspberry Pi ecosystem are good ways.
      Also, I'm involved on several initiatives like 10000 codeurs in order to raise awareness for african youth 
      on all the opportunities related to the digital.
